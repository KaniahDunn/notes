### Complete React Developer Notes

#### React Key Concepts 
- Impertative vs. Declarative 
    - Imperative: When the developer or designer directly changes componenets or aspects of an application in response on a users events
    - Declarative: Given a state on how any application should look and act and is then controlled by user action without having to manipulate the DOM everytime

- Components Architecture 
    - js function that recieve input or attributes/props that return HTML 
    - can be functional or class based 
    - easy to resuse and recycle

- Directional Data Flow
    - data can only move down from state to different components in the application
